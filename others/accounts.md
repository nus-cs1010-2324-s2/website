# CS1010 Accounts

We will be using a variety of services for CS1010.  To take CS1010, please make sure you have the following accounts:

## SoC UNIX Account

You can get one here: [https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct/](https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct/)

This account allows you to access SoC UNIX resources, including the main computing host running Solaris, `sunfire`, and computer clusters running Ubuntu / CentOS.  We will be using the compute clusters for CS1010.

Make sure that "General Unix Servers" and "The SoC Compute Cluster" are enabled in MySoC here: https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/services.cgi

## GitHub Account

CS1010 uses GitHub Classroom for programming assignment submissions and grading.  You should [register for a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you do not have one.  This account will likely stay with you for the rest of your computing career.  So choose your username wisely.

## Piazza Account

CS1010 uses Piazza for Q&A and discussion.  You should have received an email to register for Piazza.
