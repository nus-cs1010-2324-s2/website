## E-Exam Procedure

We adopt the [E-exam procedure for the School of Computing](https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/academic/e-exam-sop-for-students/) for CS1010.  This is a long document with a lot of information.  Please read through it carefully.  Please set up the software and hardware needed for taking e-exams before the test so that your test-taking experience is as smooth as possible.

Note the following supplementary information to complete the E-exam procedure above, specific to CS1010.

### 2.1 Exam Taking Software

   We will use **Luminus Quiz** for the final test.

### 2.2 Proctoring Protocol

   Note that the following applies to CS1010:

   - You are allowed to use only a single screen. If youâ€™re using an external monitor, the laptop screen must be switched off.
   - The browser running Luminuz Quiz running on your PC must be in full-screen mode.   No other tabs are allowed on the browser.

### 2.4. Seeking Clarifications on Exam Questions

   You are allowed to ask clarification questions during the exam.  However, you may only ask a boolean yes/no question.  For instance, you are not allowed to ask "What can we assume about the input?".  You should rephrase it as "Can we assume that the input is always positive?".  Our answers will only be in the form of "yes", "no", "no comment".

### 2.5. Multi-part Exam

   CS1010 final assessment is a single-part examination with no break in between.
